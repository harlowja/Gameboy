A Gameboy emulator created to better understand computer architecture, design, as well as get more experience with low level programming.

**Tested on OS X but should be cross platform**

## What isn't implemented
- Sound
- Memory mapping (switching between internal ram)

>**NOTE:** Only tested to ensure Tetris is working, other games would require more debugging
